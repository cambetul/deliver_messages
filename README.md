# deliver_messages
Background: A telecommunication company aims to deliver messages to customers’ mobile phones. They built a flexible architecture consisting of a Central Controller (CC), Base Stations (BSs) and Mobile Hosts (MHs) as in the figure1 . Since MHs can move from one BS to another, the system should be designed to find the target MH first to deliver a message. Objective: Deliver each message waiting in the delivery queue to their target MH.
